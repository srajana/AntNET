  abstract  = {Recognizing and distinguishing antonyms from other types of semantic relations
	is an essential part of language understanding systems. In this paper, we
	present a novel method for deriving antonym pairs using paraphrase pairs
	containing negation markers. We further propose a neural network model, AntNET,
	that integrates morphological features indicative of antonymy into a path-based
	relation detection algorithm. We demonstrate that our model outperforms
	state-of-the-art models in distinguishing antonyms from other semantic
	relations and is capable of efficiently handling multi-word expressions.},
